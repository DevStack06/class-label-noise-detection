A Pre-processing Method to Identify and Correct Mislabelled Data .

Here we are used many machine learning techinque to find the noisy label, and  we corrected that noisy label using preprocessing techniques.

CLASSIFIRE USED

1)Adaboost(Ensemble Learning)

2)SVM

3)Decision Tree

4)Naive Bayes 

5)Voting Classifire

6)Knn

The Methods are

1)Mode Method

2)Mean Method

3)Cluster based Boosting(only we visulized the data then we not went further .)

4)Clustering as a Feature

5)Clustering as a Feature with Semi-Supervised Learning

6)Double Addition of Cluster in Semi-Supervised Learning


Note - 1)For the detail commenting prefer mis10 ipynb file

2)cluster based boosting code is incomplete right now
